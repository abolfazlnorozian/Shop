## Set up environment variables

Rename the template.env file to .env

Open the .env file and provide the required configuration variables such as:

`MONGO_URL=`:localhost for MongoDB

`PORT=`:Database connection port number

`DBNAME=`:Insert the desired database name




If all tests pass, start the HTTP service with:

```bash
go run main.go
```
